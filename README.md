# PyFCS: A new Python library to create and manipulate Fuzzy Color Spaces
PyFCS is a Python library that introduces fuzzy color spaces for a more realistic and flexible representation of color, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. It is based on the previous work of the Java library JFCS and utilizes fuzzy logic and conceptual space theory, leveraging Python's strengths for data and image analysis.

### How to use
If no modifications to the source code are needed, follow these steps for a quick installation:

1. Access the project repository on GitHub and download the library using the \textbf{"Clone or Download"} option, or from the releases section by downloading the \texttt{.zip} file.
2. Extract the contents of the \texttt{.zip} file to a preferred local folder.
3. Open a terminal (CMD or PowerShell), navigate to the projectâ€™s root directory, and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r PyFCS\external\requirements.txt
```
4. Once the dependencies are installed, the main structure of the interface can be launched by executing:
```
python PyFCS\visualization\basic_structure.py
```
